### ðŸŽ‰ `AdvancedImage` now fully inherits from the Nova `Image` native field!

Even though this version is a minor one, it's major in terms of what it brings. And with **no breaking change!**

Many of you who use this package complained that you can't use basic `File`'s methods such as `store` or `storeAs` or `storeOriginalName`.

**Well... this is now possible!** `AdvancedImage` now fully inherits from `Image` (which inherits from `File`) so you can customize your image uploads the way you need, with cropping and resizing!

Here is a list of all the new available methods. Check out the [Nova documentation](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/resources/file-fields.html) for more details on their usage.

- `disk`
- `disableDownload`
- `storeOriginalName`
- `storeSize`
- `deletable`
- `prunable`
- `path`
- `storeAs`
- `store`
- `delete`
- `preview`
- `thumbnail`
- `squared`
- `acceptedTypes`

I hope your guys will enjoy this new release and keep giving me feedbacks on how to improve the package!
